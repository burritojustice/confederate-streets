# Confederate Streets

https://burritojustice.github.io/confederate-streets/index.html

Uses Mapzen Search to find the extent of street names and points of interest (POIs) named after Robert E. Lee. These streets and POIs serve as a signal for streets named after other confederates, which appear starting at zoom 14. 

Data is from OpenStreetMap, via Mapzen Search. Mapzen Search returns a maximum of 40 results per query. While this gave a good impression of distribution (through southern U.S.), it was obviously not exhaustive. I ran a second set of queries for streets and venues for each southern state for more detailed coverage.

Chances are that if one street is named after Robert E. Lee, nearby streets names are also named after confederates.
